      <h1> How I enjoy Disney World as an adult.</h1>
      <p>
        We'll review the three keys to enjoying Disney World (Orlando, FL) as an adult. This guide assumes the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You have no children with you on your trip (or have appropriately addressed concerns related to children; e.g. babysitter, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            You are 21+ years old, enjoy alcohol, and acknowledge your personal responsibilities while intoxicated (e.g. managing your behavior, knowing when to stop drinking, no drinking/driving, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            You aren't going to complain about me expressing my opinion
          </li>
        </ul>

        With that in mind, let's get started!

          Drinking around the world at Epcot is pretty simple, and fun- but can be dangerous.
