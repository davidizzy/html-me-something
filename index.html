      <p id="groundRules">
        We'll review the three keys to enjoying Disney World (Orlando, FL) as an adult. This guide assumes the following:
        <ul>
          <li>
            You have no children with you on your trip (or have appropriately addressed concerns related to children; e.g. babysitter, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            You are 21+ years old, enjoy alcohol, and acknowledge your personal responsibilities while intoxicated (e.g. managing your behavior, knowing when to stop drinking, no drinking/driving, etc.)
          </li>
          <li>
            You aren't going to complain about me expressing my opinion
          </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="message">
          With that in mind, let's get started!

        <h1 class="headers">Drink around-the-world at Epcot</h1>
        <p class="articleText">
          Drinking around the world at <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/destinations/epcot/" > Epcot</a> is pretty simple, and fun- but can be dangerous. If you aren't familiar with Epcot, it's theme is the world. There are stretches of this park around a lake, and each stretch is themed to a specific country. The architecture, food, and <b>drinks</b> are all representive (and sometimes seterotypical) of the theme country.
          <br />
          <br />
          Drinking around-the-world entails walking around the lake, and grabbing a regionally themed drink from each country. To ensure that you have the best time doing this, don't feel like you need to drink at every country (I skip Italy, beacuse I'm not a huge wine fan). If you manage to time this correctly, you can enjoy your last drink or two during the Epcot evening fireworks!

        <h1 class="headers">Eating at a different restruant for every meal</h1>
        <p class="articleText">
          This is where money lost, and belt notches may get added... One of the best (and most expensive) parts of Disney World is the <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/dining/">food</a>. There are many different cuisine options, price points, and dining locations across the Disney World property. Many of the restruants at Disney World (inside or outside of the parks) are world-class, internationalluy recognized establishments. At the same time, a large number of dining options are relatively afforadable- while keeping you well fed. A big plus for my family is the efforts that chefs at all Disney restruants go through to address food allergies. To ensure you get a chance to enjoy a restruant you're interested in, be sure to make reservations!

        <h1 class="headers">Be an adult, but play like a kid</h1>
        <p class="articleText">
          Remember, when you're at Disney, you're just a big kid. Go ride the rides, say hi to the characters, and stay for the fireworks. There are plenty of <a href="https://disneyworld.disney.go.com/activities/">activities</a> to keep everyone in the family busy- even if you're only with adults. Like dining, there are a large number of options and price points (including free). If you aren't going to Disney with a smile on your face, and none of the Disney activities seem appealing to you, think about whether or not you should be going to Disney.
